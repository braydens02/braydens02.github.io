## In Context of Javascript

Being a complete beginner to Javascript, I actually really enjoyed learning about it through the Codecademy course. If I were to compare it with other languages that I’ve learned, the ES6 syntax of Javascript introduced concepts completely foreign to me and it was honestly pretty hard to adapt to these concepts. I don’t know if I will be using concepts like array destructuring or arrow function syntax, but I can at least appreciate its usefulness in certain situations. 

I’m not a very proficient programmer in any one language, having learned Python, C, and C++ amongst other hardware coding languages like VHDL and systemVerilog, so I can’t really state much in terms of comparison between the languages. At first, I was very used to Python’s usage of whitespace and indentation, but I think that I prefer to have code blocks defined with braces instead now. A particular part of Javascript I do get confused about is the use of semicolons. Most of the time they’re necessary but sometimes they aren’t. 

From a software engineer’s perspective, I believe that Javascript is a good programming language because the syntax is very user friendly and intuitive to understand, as opposed to a language like C++. 

## In context of Athletic Software Engineering

I actually quite like athletic software engineering. Having practice WODs as well as the real WODs in class gives me a lot of practice and they aren’t as stressful as coding large projects where I feel like I’m spending 90% of my time debugging random errors. 

It also ensures that I keep up with the class curriculum since they occur quite often. Although having these forms of “quizzes” is stressful to have so frequently, I still think that it’s a good form of learning overall. I think that this format of learning is well-suited for me since I tend to procrastinate on large assignments whose due dates are far away.
