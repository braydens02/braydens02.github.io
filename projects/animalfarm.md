summary: "A database that stores information about different animals and their various characteristics."
---

Animal Farm is a series of labs intended to teach the basics of C and C++. It's also intended to introduce good software engineering practices.

The Animal Farm code is a software program designed to store and manage information about various animals and their characteristics.. It allows users to input data about animals, search for specific animals based on different criteria and update or delete the various information on the animals as needed. This tool simplifies the task of organizing and accessing information about animals, which was great practice on the various skills required of a software engineer.

This project took us the entire semester. We constantly made changes as we learned to fine tune our code, better utilizing various types of data structures and concepts in object-oriented programming to optimize our Animal Farm. We started the database by using arrays, which then evolved into structures. After that we implemented linked lists, and then we finally implemented binary search trees.

Here's part of a class I had to write:
