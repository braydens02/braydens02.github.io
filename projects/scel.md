My team's goal was the development and maintenance of the code utilized by the weatherboxes to acquire data from their diverse sensors and transmit it back to the laboratory. To achieve this, we chose to implement a streamlined data pipeline, which would standardize the data transmission process across the various weatherboxes deployed by our hardware teams.
